### Arguments Example + Modes 🛠️

Below are different ways to use the tool, depending on your preferred mode and proxy source. 

#### 1. **Auto Scraping Mode** (Auto Proxy "PROXYLESS") 🤖

This mode automatically scrapes proxies from various sources, ensuring you don't need to manually provide any. It runs continuously, automatically refreshing proxies after each loop.

```bash
# Usage example: Send views to the channel @teleview, post number 4
# e.g: https://t.me/teleview/4

teleview.py --mode auto --channel teleview --post 4
```

---

#### 2. **Load Proxies From File** 📂

If you have a list of proxies saved in a `.txt` file, you can use this mode to load and use them. Simply specify your file path.

```bash
# Usage example: Load HTTP proxies from the file 'http.txt' and send views to @teleview post number 4

teleview.py --type http --mode list --proxy http.txt --channel teleview --post 4
```

---

#### 3. **Using Rotating Proxies** 🔄

If you have proxies that need to rotate for each request, you can use this mode to apply rotating proxies with authentication.

```bash
# Usage example: Use rotating HTTP proxies with authentication and send views to @teleview post number 4

teleview.py -t http -m rotate -p user:password@ip:port -c teleview -pt 4
```
